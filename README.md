## Description
**Tech Quiz Test Suite** is project focuses on enhancing the reliability of the Tech Quiz application through comprehensive testing. Using the MERN stack (<span style="color: yellow;">**MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js**</span>), the app allows users to take a quiz with ten random questions and view their final score. The goal of this task is to integrate <span style="color: yellow;">**Cypress**</span> for both, component and end-to-end testing, ensuring the application performs efficiently and meets user expectations under various conditions. Testing is essential for verifying the functionality, robustness, and overall performance of modern web applications.
